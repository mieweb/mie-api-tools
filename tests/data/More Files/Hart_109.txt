Diagnostic Imaging Report

Examination:  US - Retroperitoneal Complete (Renal).
Date of Exam:  Nov 06, 2009 09:29:00 AM.
Comparison:  None.
Relevant Clinical Information:    enlarged prostate, elevated creat,
renal insuffiency.

Discussion:
Right kidney: 8 x 4.5 x 3.9 cm.
Left Kidney: 8.4 x 4.5 x 4.4 cm.
No hydronephrosis. No significant cortical thinning. The relative
small lengths of the kidneys could be compatible with patient
age/body habitus.
No stones.
Normal echogenicity.
No masses.

Bladder is initially incompletely distended with a prevoid volume of
only 12.6 mL. The post void residual is 1.2 mL. On the prevoid images
of the bladder, there is a nodular region along the lower posterior
bladder wall measuring 1.3 x 0.5 x 1.8 cm which is not clearly
contiguous with the prostate which is not well seen on the provided
images. This could represent a focal region of bladder wall
thickening, adherent debris, or other soft tissue nodule. No
shadowing to suggest a bladder stone. This is poorly evaluated given
the initial nondistended bladder.


Impression:
1.  Small renal lengths.
2.  No hydronephrosis.
3.  Incompletely distended bladder. 1.3 x 1.8 cm nodular lesion along
the lower posterior bladder wall as above.
